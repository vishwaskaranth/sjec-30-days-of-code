# Hello, SJEC!
To get things started, simply print "Hello, SJEC!" (with a catch!) in any programming language you like. We want to take things slow. The coding challenges will get harder in time, but for now, sit back, and relax. There will be no stopping you once you get going.

Ask the user for a name. If the given name is blank, print "Hello, SJEC". If any name was given, greet that name instead. 

## Sample Input 1
```
Name: 
```

## Sample Output 1
```
Hello, SJEC!
```
## Sample Input 2
```
Name: Daniel
```

## Sample Output 2
```
Hello, Daniel!
```
